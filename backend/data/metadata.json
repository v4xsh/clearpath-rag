    "text": "Employment Basics\nEmployment Classification: ClearPath employees are classified as either exempt (salaried) or\nnon-exempt (hourly). Your offer letter specifies your classification. Full-time employees work 40 hours\nper week. Part-time employees work fewer than 30 hours per week and are not eligible for all benefits.\nProbationary Period: All new employees have a 90-day probationary period. During this time, we'll\nwork together to ensure the role is a good fit. You'll have regular check-ins with your manager and a\nformal review at 30, 60, and 90 days.\nBackground Checks: Employment is contingent on successful completion of background checks and\nverification of eligibility to work in your country of employment.\nWorking Hours and Schedule\nStandard working hours are 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM local time, Monday through Friday, with a one-hour\nlunch break (unpaid for non-exempt employees). We understand that life happens and flexibility is\nimportant. Flexible start times (between 7:00 AM and 10:00 AM) are available with manager approval.\nCore Hours: All team members should be available during core collaboration hours: 10:00 AM to 3:00\nPM in their primary timezone. This ensures adequate overlap for meetings and real-time collaboration.\nRemote employees should maintain this overlap with their immediate team.\n\n\n\nOvertime: Non-exempt employees who work more than 40 hours in a workweek will be paid overtime\nat 1.5x their regular rate. All overtime must be pre-approved by your manager. Exempt employees are\nnot eligible for overtime pay.\nTimekeeping: Non-exempt employees must accurately track their hours using our time tracking\nsystem (BambooHR). Timesheets are due every Friday and are reviewed and approved by your\nmanager. Falsification of time records is grounds for termination.\nCompensation\nPay Schedule: Employees are paid semi-monthly on the 15th and last day of each month. If payday\nfalls on a weekend or holiday, payment will be made on the preceding business day. Direct deposit is\nrequired for all employees.\nSalary Reviews: ClearPath conducts annual",

    "text": "Q4 2023 Team Retrospective\nQ4 2023 Team Retrospective\nDate: December 20, 2023 | Facilitator: Jordan Kim | Attendees: Full Engineering Team (18 people)\nRetrospective Format\nWe used the 'Start/Stop/Continue' format with anonymous input via Miro. Everyone submitted their\nthoughts ahead of time, then we grouped similar items and voted on top priorities. This retro covered\nOctober-December 2023.\nWhat Went Well I\nThe team identified many successes this quarter:\nShipping Timeline View (2 months early!):\nWe delivered the Timeline view feature in October, two months ahead of our Q1 2024 target. The team\nworked collaboratively, frontend and backend pairing effectively. Alex led the charge with excellent\ntechnical design. Customer feedback has been overwhelmingly positive - it's our most-requested\nfeature in years and early metrics show 60% of Pro users are using it weekly.\nPerformance Improvements:\nJordan's database optimization work improved API response times by 40% on average. The /projects\nendpoint that was timing out for large workspaces now loads in under 200ms. We added proper\nindexes and rewrote some N+1 queries. This required careful testing but the results were worth it.\nBug Backlog Reduction:\nWe reduced our bug backlog from 150 to 45 bugs. The team dedicated Fridays to bug fixes and it paid\noff. Customer support tickets related to bugs dropped by 35%. Morale improved knowing we were\ntackling technical debt.\nMobile App Rewrite:\nSam's mobile team completed the React Native rewrite. The new app is faster, more reliable, and sets\nus up for feature parity with web. App Store ratings improved from 3.8 to 4.6 stars. The team showed\ngreat discipline in not rushing and maintaining code quality.\nTeam Collaboration:\nCross-team collaboration was excellent. Frontend and backend worked together on Timeline without\nsilos. Platform team was responsive to infrastructure needs. Code reviews were thorough but\nrespectful. People are genuinely helping each other succeed.\nNew Hire Onboarding:\nOur three new engineers (hired in Oct/Nov) ramp",

Frontend and backend worked together on Timeline without\nsilos. Platform team was responsive to infrastructure needs. Code reviews were thorough but\nrespectful. People are genuinely helping each other succeed.\nNew Hire Onboarding:\nOur three new engineers (hired in Oct/Nov) ramped up quickly thanks to improved onboarding docs\nand buddy system. All three shipped code in their first two weeks. They felt welcomed and supported.\nWhat Didn't Go Well I\nThe team was honest about challenges this quarter:\n\n\n\nIntegration Testing Still Manual:\nWe're still manually testing integrations before each release. It's time-consuming (3-4 hours per\nrelease) and error-prone. We missed a Slack integration bug that made it to production. Customers\nwere frustrated. We need automated integration tests urgently.\nDocumentation Fell Behind:\nOur docs are 2-3 releases behind code. New features shipped without updated documentation. Support\nteam is fielding questions that should be in docs. Internal docs (architecture diagrams, runbooks) are\nalso outdated. This creates friction for new team members.\nPR Review Bottlenecks:\nSome PRs sat for 3-5 days without review. This blocked progress and frustrated engineers. The\nproblem was worse during vacation season (Thanksgiving week). We need clearer expectations about\nreview turnaround and perhaps a rotating 'PR czar' to ensure nothing falls through cracks.\nProduction Incidents Increased:\nWe had 7 production incidents in November (up from 3-4 typical). Most were caught quickly but we\nneed better monitoring and alerting. Also need to do post-mortems consistently - we skipped some\nbecause we were 'too busy' but that's how problems repeat.\nEstimation Accuracy:\nOur sprint estimates were consistently off by 30-50%. We're either being too optimistic or not\naccounting for unknowns. This makes planning difficult and creates stress at sprint end. We need to\nimprove our estimation process or build in more buffer.\nMeeting Fatigue:\nSeveral people mentioned feeling over-meetinged. Too many sync meetings, some recurring meetings\nthat could be async, and calendar Tetris",
